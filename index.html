<h1>All My Life For Sale</h1>  
<p>John Freyer created All My Life for Sale, an online project created in 2001. Freyer sold every item he owned, from his clothes to his bed sheet, on the online marketplace eBay and his website Allmylifeforsale.com. The image above features some of the items that were bought from Freyer’s home. He discussed the project with all top bidders and asked for updates on the items in their new home. The project explored people’s relationship between the things they own and their identity.</p>
